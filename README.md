# Personal Notion Raycast Extension

This Raycast extension is for managing my personal Notion databases. It allows
me to quickly manage entries in contexts where I may not currently be in the
Notion app.

## Commands

### Add Person

I like to keep a list of important people in my lifeâ€”I use Notion to track
anything from gift ideas to meetings we've had, etc. This allows me to quickly
add people to the database.

### Add Hubber

I keep a list of my colleages at GitHub that I interact with so that I can notes
on prior conversations we've had and projects we've worked on together. This
command helps me add a Hubber quickly, and automates setting the context and
photo fields in my people database.
